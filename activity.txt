The image showeryz.png is a YZ plot of muon airshower data from the NoVA far detector

Your goal is to perform fft on the image and plot the original image, the frequency domain 
before you apply the filter, and the frequency domain after you apply the filter.
What do you notice about the frequency domain before and after the filter?

Once you try this with a Gaussian filter, try representing the filter with 
different mathematical expressions and see what you get!
